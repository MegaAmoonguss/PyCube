# PyCube

What will eventually be a fully featured Rubik's Cube timing program. Hopefully. Uses the WCA official cube scrambling site's JavaScript for scrambling.

## To do
* Make actually useful GUI
* Add ways to change cube, scramble length, multi-slice, etc
* Add more statistics
* Add score comparison to WCA records (?)
* Make means, standard deviations, and averages update on penaly or DNF
* Make it so you can only penalize the most recent time?
